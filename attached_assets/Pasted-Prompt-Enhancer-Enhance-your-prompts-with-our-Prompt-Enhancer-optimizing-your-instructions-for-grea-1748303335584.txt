Prompt Enhancer
Enhance your prompts with our Prompt Enhancer, optimizing your instructions for greater efficiency and effectiveness in your image generation tasks.
Introduction
Prompt enhancement is a powerful tool designed to refine and diversify the results generated for a specific topic. By incorporating additional keywords into a given prompt, this feature aims to expand the scope and creativity of the generated images.

It's important to note that while prompt enhancement can produce varied results, it may not always maintain the exact subject focus of the original prompt and does not guarantee superior outcomes compared to the original input.

Request
Our API always accepts an array of objects as input, where each object represents a specific task to be performed. The structure of the object varies depending on the type of the task. For this section, we will focus on the parameters related to the prompt enhancement task.

The following JSON snippets shows the basic structure of a request object. All properties are explained in detail in the next section.

[
  {
    "taskType": "promptEnhance",

    "prompt": "dog",
    "promptMaxLength": 64,
    "promptVersions": 4
  }
]
taskType
string
required
The type of task to be performed. For this task, the value should be promptEnhance.

taskUUID
string
required
UUID v4
When a task is sent to the API you must include a random UUID v4 string using the taskUUID parameter. This string is used to match the async responses to their corresponding tasks.

If you send multiple tasks at the same time, the taskUUID will help you match the responses to the correct tasks.

The taskUUID must be unique for each task you send to the API.

includeCost
boolean
Default: false
If set to true, the cost to perform the task will be included in the response object.

prompt
string

Min: 1
Max: 300
The prompt that you intend to enhance.

promptMaxLength
integer
required
Min: 12
Max: 400
Represents the maximum length of the enhanced prompt that you intend to receive expressed in tokens. Approximately 100 tokens correspond to about 75 words or 500 characters.

promptVersions
integer
required
Min: 1
Max: 5
The number of prompt versions that will be received.
