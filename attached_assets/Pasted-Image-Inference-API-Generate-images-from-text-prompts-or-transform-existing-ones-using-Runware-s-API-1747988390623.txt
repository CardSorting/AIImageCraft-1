Image Inference API
Generate images from text prompts or transform existing ones using Runware's API. Learn how to do image inference for creative and high-quality results.
Introduction
Image inference is a powerful feature that allows you to generate images from text prompts or transform existing images according to your needs. This process is essential for creating high-quality visuals, whether you're looking to bring creative ideas to life or enhance existing images with new styles or subjects.

There are several types of image inference requests you can make using our API:

Text-to-image: Generate images from descriptive text prompts. This process translates your text into high-quality visuals, allowing you to create detailed and vivid images based on your ideas.
Image-to-image: Perform transformations on existing images, whether they are previously generated images or uploaded images. This process enables you to enhance, modify, or stylize images to create new and visually appealing content. With a single parameter you can control the strength of the transformation.
Inpainting: Replace parts of an image with new content, allowing you to remove unwanted elements or improve the overall composition of an image. It's like image-to-image but with a mask that defines the area to be transformed.
Outpainting: Extend the boundaries of an image by generating new content outside the original frame that seamlessly blends with the existing image. As inpainting, it uses a mask to define the new area to be generated.
Our API also supports advanced features that allow developers to fine-tune the image generation process with precision:

ControlNet: A feature that enables precise control over image generation by using additional input conditions, such as edge maps, poses, or segmentation masks. This allows for more accurate alignment with specific user requirements or styles.
LoRA: A technique that helps in adapting models to specific styles or tasks by focusing on particular aspects of the data, enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated images.
Additionally, you can tweak numerous parameters to customize the output, such as adjusting the image dimension, steps, scheduler to use, and other generation settings, providing a high level of flexibility to suit your application's needs.

Our API is really fast because we have unique optimizations, custom-designed hardware, and many other elements that are part of our Sonic Inference Engine.

Request
Our API always accepts an array of objects as input, where each object represents a specific task to be performed. The structure of the object varies depending on the type of the task. For this section, we will focus on the parameters related to image inference tasks.

The following JSON snippets shows the basic structure of a request object. All properties are explained in detail in the next section.

[
  {
    "taskType": "imageInference",
    "taskUUID": "string",
    "outputType": "string",
    "outputFormat": "string",
    "positivePrompt": "string",
    "negativePrompt": "string",
    "height": int,
    "width": int,
    "model": "string",
    "steps": int,
    "CFGScale": float,
    "numberResults": int
  }
]
You can mix multiple ControlNet and LoRA objects in the same request to achieve more complex control over the generation process.

taskType
string
required
The type of task to be performed. For this task, the value should be imageInference.

taskUUID
string
required
UUID v4
When a task is sent to the API you must include a random UUID v4 string using the taskUUID parameter. This string is used to match the async responses to their corresponding tasks.

If you send multiple tasks at the same time, the taskUUID will help you match the responses to the correct tasks.

The taskUUID must be unique for each task you send to the API.

outputType
"base64Data" | "dataURI" | "URL"
Default: URL
Specifies the output type in which the image is returned. Supported values are: dataURI, URL, and base64Data.

base64Data: The image is returned as a base64-encoded string using the imageBase64Data parameter in the response object.
dataURI: The image is returned as a data URI string using the imageDataURI parameter in the response object.
URL: The image is returned as a URL string using the imageURL parameter in the response object.
outputFormat
"JPG" | "PNG" | "WEBP"
Default: JPG
Specifies the format of the output image. Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

outputQuality
integer
Min: 20
Max: 99
Default: 95
Sets the compression quality of the output image. Higher values preserve more quality but increase file size, lower values reduce file size but decrease quality.

uploadEndpoint
string
This parameter allows you to specify a URL to which the generated image will be uploaded as binary image data using the HTTP PUT method. For example, an S3 bucket URL can be used as the upload endpoint.

When the image is ready, it will be uploaded to the specified URL.

checkNSFW
boolean
Default: false
This parameter is used to enable or disable the NSFW check. When enabled, the API will check if the image contains NSFW (not safe for work) content. This check is done using a pre-trained model that detects adult content in images.

When the check is enabled, the API will return NSFWContent: true in the response object if the image is flagged as potentially sensitive content. If the image is not flagged, the API will return NSFWContent: false.

If this parameter is not used, the parameter NSFWContent will not be included in the response object.

Adds 0.1 seconds to image inference time and incurs additional costs.

The NSFW filter occasionally returns false positives and very rarely false negatives.

includeCost
boolean
Default: false
If set to true, the cost to perform the task will be included in the response object.

positivePrompt
string
required
A positive prompt is a text instruction to guide the model on generating the image. It is usually a sentence or a paragraph that provides positive guidance for the task. This parameter is essential to shape the desired results.

For example, if the positive prompt is "dragon drinking coffee", the model will generate an image of a dragon drinking coffee. The more detailed the prompt, the more accurate the results.

If you wish to generate an image without any prompt guidance, you can use the special token __BLANK__. This tells the system to generate an image without text-based instructions.

The length of the prompt must be between 2 and 3000 characters.

negativePrompt
string
A negative prompt is a text instruction to guide the model on generating the image. It is usually a sentence or a paragraph that provides negative guidance for the task. This parameter helps to avoid certain undesired results.

For example, if the negative prompt is "red dragon, cup", the model will follow the positive prompt but will avoid generating an image of a red dragon or including a cup. The more detailed the prompt, the more accurate the results.

The length of the prompt must be between 2 and 3000 characters.

seedImage
string
required
When doing Image-to-Image, Inpainting or Outpainting, this parameter is required.

Specifies the seed image to be used for the diffusion process. The image can be specified in one of the following formats:

An UUID v4 string of a previously uploaded image or a generated image.
A data URI string representing the image. The data URI must be in the format data:<mediaType>;base64, followed by the base64-encoded image. For example: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo....
A base64 encoded image without the data URI prefix. For example: iVBORw0KGgo....
A URL pointing to the image. The image must be accessible publicly.
Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

maskImage
string
required
When doing Inpainting, this parameter is required.

Specifies the mask image to be used for the inpainting process. The image can be specified in one of the following formats:

An UUID v4 string of a previously uploaded image or a generated image.
A data URI string representing the image. The data URI must be in the format data:<mediaType>;base64, followed by the base64-encoded image. For example: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo....
A base64 encoded image without the data URI prefix. For example: iVBORw0KGgo....
A URL pointing to the image. The image must be accessible publicly.
Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

maskMargin
integer
Min: 32
Max: 128
Adds extra context pixels around the masked region during inpainting. When this parameter is present, the model will zoom into the masked area, considering these additional pixels to create more coherent and well-integrated details.

This parameter is particularly effective when used with masks generated by the Image Masking API, enabling enhanced detail generation while maintaining natural integration with the surrounding image.

strength
float
Min: 0
Max: 1
Default: 0.8
When doing Image-to-Image or Inpainting, this parameter is used to determine the influence of the seedImage image in the generated output. A lower value results in more influence from the original image, while a higher value allows more creative deviation.

outpaint
object
Extends the image boundaries in specified directions. When using outpaint, you must provide the final dimensions using width and height parameters, which should account for the original image size plus the total extension (seedImage dimensions + top + bottom, left + right).

top
integer
Min: 0
Number of pixels to extend at the top of the image. Must be a multiple of 64.

right
integer
Min: 0
Number of pixels to extend at the right side of the image. Must be a multiple of 64.

bottom
integer
Min: 0
Number of pixels to extend at the bottom of the image. Must be a multiple of 64.

left
integer
Min: 0

Default: 0
The amount of blur to apply at the boundaries between the original image and the extended areas, measured in pixels.

height
integer
required
Min: 128
Max: 2048
Used to define the height dimension of the generated image. Certain models perform better with specific dimensions.

The value must be divisible by 64, eg: 128...512, 576, 640...2048.

width
integer
required
Min: 128
Max: 2048
Used to define the width dimension of the generated image. Certain models perform better with specific dimensions.

The value must be divisible by 64, eg: 128...512, 576, 640...2048.

model
string
required
We make use of the AIR (Artificial Intelligence Resource) system to identify models. This identifier is a unique string that represents a specific model.

You can find the AIR identifier of the model you want to use in our Model Explorer, which is a tool that allows you to search for models based on their characteristics.

vae
string
We make use of the AIR (Artificial Intelligence Resource) system to identify VAE models. This identifier is a unique string that represents a specific model.

The VAE (Variational Autoencoder) can be specified to override the default one included with the base model, which can help improve the quality of generated images.

You can find the AIR identifier of the VAE model you want to use in our Model Explorer, which is a tool that allows you to search for models based on their characteristics.

steps
integer
Min: 1
Max: 100
Default: 20
The number of steps is the number of iterations the model will perform to generate the image. The higher the number of steps, the more detailed the image will be. However, increasing the number of steps will also increase the time it takes to generate the image and may not always result in a better image (some schedulers work differently).

When using your own models you can specify a new default value for the number of steps.

scheduler
string
Default: Model's scheduler
An scheduler is a component that manages the inference process. Different schedulers can be used to achieve different results like more detailed images, faster inference, or more accurate results.

The default scheduler is the one that the model was trained with, but you can choose a different one to get different results.

Schedulers are explained in more detail in the Schedulers page.

seed
integer
Min: 1
Max: 9223372036854776000
Default: Random
A seed is a value used to randomize the image generation. If you want to make images reproducible (generate the same image multiple times), you can use the same seed value.

When requesting multiple images with the same seed, the seed will be incremented by 1 (+1) for each image generated.

CFGScale
float
Min: 0
Max: 50
Default: 7
Guidance scale represents how closely the images will resemble the prompt or how much freedom the AI model has. Higher values are closer to the prompt. Low values may reduce the quality of the results.

clipSkip
integer
Min: 0
Max: 2
Defines additional layer skips during prompt processing in the CLIP model. Some models already skip layers by default - this parameter adds extra skips on top of those. Different values affect how your prompt is interpreted, which can lead to variations in the generated image.

promptWeighting
string
Defines the syntax to be used for prompt weighting.

Prompt weighting allows you to adjust how strongly different parts of your prompt influence the generated image. Choose between compel notation with advanced weighting operations or sdEmbeds for simple emphasis adjustments.


numberResults
integer
Min: 1
Max: 20
Default: 1
The number of images to generate from the specified prompt.

If seed is set, it will be incremented by 1 (+1) for each image generated.

acceleratorOptions
object
Advanced caching mechanisms to significantly speed up image generation by reducing redundant computation. This object allows you to enable and configure acceleration technologies for your specific model architecture.

These caching methods will not perform well with stochastic schedulers (those with SDE or Ancestral in the name). The random noise added by these schedulers prevents the cache from working effectively. For best results, use deterministic schedulers like Euler or DDIM.

teaCache
boolean
Default: false
Enables or disables the TeaCache feature, which accelerates image generation by reusing past computations.

TeaCache is specifically designed for transformer-based models such as Flux and SD3, and does not work with UNet models like SDXL or SD1.5.

This feature is particularly effective for iterative image editing and prompt refinement workflows.

teaCacheDistance
float
Min: 0
Max: 1
Default: 0.5
Controls the aggressiveness of the TeaCache feature. Values range from 0.0 (most conservative) to 1.0 (most aggressive).

Lower values prioritize quality by being more selective about which computations to reuse, while higher values prioritize speed by reusing more computations.

Example: A value of 0.1 is very conservative, maintaining high quality with modest speed improvements, while 0.6 is more aggressive, yielding greater speed gains with potential minor quality trade-offs.

deepCache
boolean
Default: false
Enables or disables the DeepCache feature, which speeds up diffusion-based image generation by caching internal feature maps from the neural network.

DeepCache is designed for UNet-based models like SDXL and SD1.5, and is not applicable to transformer-based models like Flux and SD3.

DeepCache can provide significant performance improvements for high-throughput scenarios or when generating multiple similar images.

deepCacheInterval
integer
Min: 1
Default: 3
Represents the frequency of feature caching, specified as the number of steps between each cache operation.

A larger interval value will make inference faster but may impact quality. A smaller interval prioritizes quality over speed.

deepCacheBranchId
integer
Min: 0
Default: 0
Determines which branch of the network (ordered from the shallowest to the deepest layer) is responsible for executing the caching processes.

Lower branch IDs (e.g., 0) result in more aggressive caching for faster generation, while higher branch IDs produce more conservative caching with potentially higher quality results.

puLID
object
PuLID (Pure and Lightning ID Customization) enables fast and high-quality identity customization for text-to-image generation. This object allows you to configure settings for transferring facial characteristics from a reference image to generated images with high fidelity.

inputImages
string[]
required
Min: 1
Max: 1
An array containing the reference image used for identity customization. The reference image provides the facial characteristics that will be preserved and integrated into the generated images.

Currently, only a single image is supported, so the array should contain exactly one element with a clear, high-quality face that will serve as the identity source.

The image can be specified in one of the following formats:

An UUID v4 string of a previously uploaded image or a generated image.
A data URI string representing the image. The data URI must be in the format data:<mediaType>;base64, followed by the base64-encoded image. For example: data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo....
A base64 encoded image without the data URI prefix. For example: iVBORw0KGgo....
A URL pointing to the image. The image must be accessible publicly.
Supported formats are: PNG, JPG and WEBP.

idWeight
integer
Min: 0
Max: 3
Default: 1
Controls the strength of identity preservation in the generated image. Higher values create outputs that more closely resemble the facial characteristics of the input image, while lower values allow for more creative interpretation while still maintaining some identity features.

trueCFGScale
float
Min: 0
Max: 10
Controls the guidance scale specifically for PuLID's identity embedding process. This parameter modifies how closely the generated image follows the identity characteristics from the reference image while balancing prompt adherence.

Higher values result in stronger identity preservation and more faithful reproduction of facial features from the reference image. Lower values allow for more creative interpretation while still maintaining recognizable identity features.

This parameter works in conjunction with the main CFGScale parameter but specifically targets the identity embedding component of the generation process.

CFGStartStep
integer
Min: 0
Max: 10
Controls when identity features begin to influence the image generation process.

Lower values apply identity features earlier in the generation process, resulting in stronger resemblance to the reference face but with less creative freedom in composition and style. Higher values do the opposite.

For photorealistic images, starting as early as possible typically works best. For stylized images (cartoon, anime, etc.), starting a bit later can provide better results.

Alternative parameters: puLID.startStepPercentageCFG.

CFGStartStepPercentage
integer
Min: 0
Max: 100
Determines at what percentage of the total generation steps the identity features begin to influence the image.

Lower percentages apply identity features earlier in the generation process, creating stronger resemblance to the reference face but with less creative freedom in composition and style. Higher percentages do the opposite.

For photorealistic images, starting as early as possible typically works best. For stylized images (cartoon, anime, etc.), starting a bit later can provide better results.

Alternative parameters: puLID.startStepCFG.

refiner

startStep
integer
Min: 2
Max: {steps}
Represents the step number at which the refinement process begins. The initial model will generate the image up to this step, after which the refiner model takes over to enhance the result.

It can take values from 2 (second step) to the number of steps specified.

Alternative parameters: refiner.startStepPercentage.

startStepPercentage
integer
Min: 1
Max: 99
Represents the percentage of total steps at which the refinement process begins. The initial model will generate the image up to this percentage of steps before the refiner takes over.

It can take values from 1 to 99.

Alternative parameters: refiner.startStep.
